## 📋 Key Features

- **✨ AI-Powered Email Drafting – Generates context-aware acceptance/rejection emails, parked in the dashboard for review and personalization.
- **✨ Custom Access Codes – Secure, one-time codes unlock the scheduling modal for consultations.
- **✨ Real-Time Scheduling – Clients book based on shared availability, preventing double-booking.
- **✨ Automated Zoom Integration – Confirmation emails include unique Zoom links for consultations.
- **✨ Client Lifecycle Tracking – Dashboard tracks every stage: Pending → Accepted/Rejected → Booked.
- **✨ Employee Authentication – Secure internal access for team members only.


## 🌟 Project Overview

Unlike generic booking platforms, Chai & Co is a full-stack system that streamline the booking process for both clients and the team, while preserving a personalized, high-end experience.

## 👥 Client Experience

- **✨ Browse past work and submit a short inquiry form (name, contact, guest size, event details).

- **✨ All further communication happens via email for simplicity.

- **✨ Accepted clients receive a custom access code to unlock a scheduling modal, booking directly from shared availability.

- **✨ Booking confirmation emails include a unique Zoom link for their consultation.

- **✨ Clients feel valued and exclusive, knowing their ideas are prioritized over generic event templates.

## 🛠 Team Workflow

- **⚡ Manage all inquiries through a central dashboard instead of scattered emails/DMs.

- **⚡ Inquiry forms sync automatically, allowing quick accept/reject decisions.

- **⚡ One-click triggers AI-generated draft emails (acceptance or rejection), including access codes when relevant.

- **⚡ Drafts are saved and editable in the dashboard until approved and sent.

- **⚡ Client statuses (Pending, Accepted, Rejected, Booked) update live, keeping the team aligned.

- **⚡ Booked clients’ Zoom links and appointment times are automatically logged in the dashboard.

➡️ This system reduces manual back-and-forth by up to 80% while still delivering a luxury, client-first experience.
