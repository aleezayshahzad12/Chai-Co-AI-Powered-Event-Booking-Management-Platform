# Chai-Co-AI-Powered-Event-Booking-Management-Platform
This project is a full-stack event inquiry and booking system designed to streamline client communication and internal team workflows. It integrates AI-generated email drafting with a human-in-the-loop review process, ensuring efficiency without losing personalization.

🌟 Project Overview

Unlike generic booking platforms, Chai & Co was built to streamline the booking process for both clients and the team, while preserving a personalized, high-end experience.

👥 Client Experience

1. Clients browse the company’s past work and submit a short inquiry form (name, contact, guest size, event details).

2. All communication shifts to email for a seamless experience.

3. Accepted clients receive a custom access code that unlocks a scheduling modal — allowing them to directly book consultations based on both client and team availability.

4. Booking confirmation emails include a unique Zoom link, so clients simply click to join on the day of their consultation.

5. This process creates an exclusive club feel — clients know their ideas are being taken seriously, not lost in generic event planning.

🛠 Team Workflow

1. Instead of juggling Instagram DMs, emails, and texts, the team manages all inquiries through a central dashboard.

2. Inquiry forms automatically sync to the dashboard, where the team can filter, accept, or reject clients.

3. With one click, the system generates AI-written draft emails (acceptance or rejection).

      . Drafts include custom access codes.

      . Drafts are parked in the dashboard until reviewed, personalized, and approved for sending.

      . All drafts remain saved and editable until finalized.

4. Rejection emails follow the same workflow, ensuring consistency.

5. Client statuses (Pending, Accepted, Rejected, Booked) are tracked live in the dashboard.

6. Once a client books, their status updates to “Booked,” and the dashboard logs their unique Zoom link and appointment time.

➡️ This system reduces manual back-and-forth by up to 80% while still delivering a luxury, client-first experience.
